 Write a program to create following scenario:

abstract class VehicleType having:
private field: vehicle_type  (Eg: scooter, car, bus)
Use parameterized constructor to initialize the attribute. Make setter & getter methods for
the attribute.

An interface Color having:
default method: getColor()  which returns color (default: “white”) of vehicle

An interface MfgDate having:
abstract method: getMfgDate()  will be used to return manufacturing date of vehicle

Now create a class Vehicle which inherits MfgDate, Color & VehicleType and having:
private field: mfg_date  to store the manufacturing date of vehicle
Use parameterized constructor to initialize the attribute. Make setter & getter methods for
the attribute.

Create Test class having main() method in which you have to make at least 5 objects of the
Vehicle class and store them in ArrayList. Create another method named serializeVehicles() 
which will store all objects in a file named “Records.txt”. Now make another method named
deserializeVehicles() which will read and display all those objects from the file whose
manufacturing-date is > 2018.

Note: Don’t make any separate instance variable other than the ones specified in above
scenario. Also mfg_date variable is to be taken as LocalDate object rather than String
object. Also, make use proper exception handling by using inbuilt exception-classes and
also make your own custom exception class to deal with the exceptions such as user
entering a negative no.
